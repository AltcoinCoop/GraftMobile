# Features of Mobile Clients

Currently, Mobile Clients are read-only and cannot process transactions.
This document contains the list of available features of Mobile Clients.

## Select Network

Graft Mobile Clients support three types of network:
*  Mainnet - the production network with real coins;
*  Public Testnet - the public test network for beginners which want to try 
how Graft Ecosystem is working;
*  Public RTA Testnet - the public experimental test network which provides 
the unreleased version of Real-Time Authorization functionality. For more 
details about Real-Time Authorization see 
[Graft Network Whitepaper](https://www.graft.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Graft-1.1.pdf).

The mobile client works only with one network at same time. When you install 
Graft Mobile Client at the first time the application will propose to select 
the network and create or restore your Graft wallet.

enter your password. Then the application will clear your account data and 
propose to select another network.

New Wallet" button.

client.

the privacy of your data, you can leave the password field empty.

### Restore Wallet

Alternatively to the wallet creation, you can restore your wallet from the 
mnemonic phrase. For this press "Restore Wallet" button, enter the mnemonic 
phrase and password. Then press "Restore" button, if everything is OK, the 
application restores account and open the main screen.

**Note**: The password need only for security reason, if you don't worry about 
the privacy of your data, you can leave the password field empty.

### View Mnemonic Phrase

Such as the mnemonic phrase is very important to restore your Graft wallet, the 
application provides the way to view the mnemonic phrase even if you had already
created an account, but for some reason, you forgot or didn't copy the mnemonic 
phrase.

To view the mnemonic phrase go to the Settings and press "Show Mnemonic 
Password" button. The application will ask you to enter your password if the 
password is correct, you will see the mnemonic phrase.
